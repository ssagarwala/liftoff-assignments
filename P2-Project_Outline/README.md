# Project Outline / Overview
     A channel where students can sell their books to their peers instead of to the book store.
     Students/users can list their books free using this application. Potential buyers can search
     for books by entering title, book author or key word. They can also limit the search to
     within their specified zip code.

## Assignment Description
    Thousands of people rush to the book store to buy books in the beginning of their quarter at a
    community college. Most of the time their preference is to buy used books which cost almost
    10 dollars less than the new books. They feel that they have made a better decision to buy used
    books and have saved some money to be spent on other miscellaneous items as the quarter progresses.
    After the quarter ends and the book store advertises a book buy back, students think that they
    should sell the book back to the book store and get their money back.If not the whole amount
    that they spent then may be 10 or 20 dollars less than the price they originally bought for.
    To their surprise when they walk in the bookstore to sell the 65 dollar book back. They surprised
    to find that the book store is only willing to pay 5 dollars for it. When the person sells the book
    for 5 dollars the book store puts the same book back on the self for 65.

    In this app people from a community college/university/zip code can sell their books to their
    peers instead of selling it back to the bookstore. This would save them not only the money
    they spent on the book but also on the sales tax. People can buy or sell their books at a
    convenient location. Also, people would not have to put on any advertisements on bulletin boards
    hoping to sell books for full price.
